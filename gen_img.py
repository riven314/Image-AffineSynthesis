"""
aggregate several layers to generate an image, init by sampling parameters
- instance group (tgt with color change for reducing color contrast)
- background (can use SinGAN to generate that)
- (add air bubble / extra noise)
- (apply gaussian blur on overall image)

** retrieve bounding box ground truth
